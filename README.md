# python-challenge

## Project Description:
This project contains two separate sub-projects, both of which use python script to analyse trends in:

1. **PyBank:**
Monthly financial records for a company between January 2010 and February 2017.

3. **PyPoll:**
Polling station vote counts for three political candidates standing for election in three different counties.
   
## Installation and Run Instructions:
Each project contains the same files, namely:
1. **Analysis subfolder:** output from the completed analysis, saved as a .txt file;
2. **Resources subfolder:** the original datafile, saved as a .csv file, and;
3. **main.py:** the python script used to generate the analysis.


## Usage Instructions:
For both the **PyBank** and **PyPoll** projects, executing the respective python script provided in the **main.py** file will execute the analysis.

**PyBank:**
Executing this script will output the following information:
1. The total number of months included in the dataset;
2. The net profit/loss over the entire period;
3. Change in profit/loss over the entire period and the average of these changes;
4. Greatest increase in profits over the entire period, and;
5. Greatest decrease in profits over the entire period.

**PyPoll:**
Executing this script will output the following information: 
1. The total number of votes cast;
2. A complete list of candidates who received votes;
3. The percentage of votes each candidate won;
4. The total number of votes each candidate won;
5. The winner of the election based on the popular vote.
